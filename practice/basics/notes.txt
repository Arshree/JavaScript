for-of loop
for(let val of strVar){
do some work} -no initilization and no updation, nostopping condition
this is used only for arrays and strings

for-in loops - uses for objects
for(let key in objVar){
    do some work
}

************STRING************
-> String is a sequence of charecters used to represent text.
ex: let str = "Arun" or 'arun';
check index str[1]

=> Templete Literals In JS
A way to have embedded expression in string. - back tik - ``
let spacialString = `This is a Templete Literal`
console.log(spacialString);

\n - escape charecter is use for in string go to next line
\t - tab scape and its both escape and tab consider one 1 charecter

String methods (Block of code): functions : These are built-in fuctions manipulate a string. 
let str = "arun";
console.log(str.length());

str.toUpperCase();
str.length;
str.toLowercase();
str.slice(start, end); //return part of the string
str1.concat(str2); //joins str2 with str1
str.replace(searchVar, newVar);
str.replacAll(searchVar, newVar);
str.charAt(idx); 

****************ARRAYS**************************
Arrays: 
Collection of items - linear(values are store in single line fashion/linear fashion)

create Array
array.length - its property
array is special type of object

Looping over an Array - Print all elements of an array

Array mentods: Array have multiple methods(0 some will retrun the new array, some not return)

push(): this will help to add new array in exist array from end.
ex: let arr = [12, 13,14,15];
arr.push(16); = return arr = [12,13,14,15,16];

pop(): It will help to delete array from end.
arr.pop(); - return arr = [12,13,14];

toString(): convert array to string.
ex: arr.toString();

concat(): joins multi arrays in one arrays.
ex: let arr2 = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
console.log(arr.concat(arr2));

unshift(): its work like same push(), but difference is add from start.
arr.unshift(11);

shift(): its work same like pop(), but difference is delete from strt.
arr.shift(11);

slice(): return the piece of the array 
arr.slice(1,3);

splice(): : change original array(add, remove, replace) - not change the original array.
if u not pass any value in splice() its act as slice().


*****************Functions/Methods*****************

Functions() in JS: Block of the code that performs a special task, can be invoked whenever needed.

Functions definiions

function functionName() {
    //do some work
}

function functionName(paramiter1, parameter2,...){
    //do some work
}

Functions call

functionName();

Function have return and after return we can't write any code and whatever parameter u passed in function they 
are only local variable and its only for that block of scope variables(block of scope). 
We can't call that variable out side of the block.

Arrow Functions(=>): is a part of moder JS 
Compact way of writing a function
how to write this 
const vairiableName = (parameter1, parameter2)=>{
    //do something main code
}


for each loop in Arrays

arr.forEach(callBackFunction)

CallbackFunction : Here, it is a function to execute for each element in the array
*A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

arr.forEach((val)=>{
    console.log(val)
})

Higher order function/methods
Its take another function as paramenter or return another function is called higher order function

Map: map creates a new array with results of some operation. The value its callback returns are used to 
form new array.
arr.map(callbackFnx(value, idx, array))

Filter: Creates new array of elemnets that give true for a condition/filter.
eg: all even elements.

Reduce(): Performs some opertions and reduces the array to a single value. its returns the single value.


The 3 musketeers of Web Application is 
1. HTML (Hyper text Markp Language) (Structure)
2. CSS (Style) cascading style sheet
3. JS (logic) Java script

//shift + ! - is help to give basic code of HTML
we can write direct 
<style>
h1 {
    background-color: pink;
}

When developer creating new files for css and JS it will help for 
=> readability(easy to read the code)
=> modular
=> browser cache

Window:
The window object represents an open window in browser. It is browser's object (not Java Script's) 
and its automatically creates by browser.
It is a global object with lots of methods and objects. (we can say prent of all methods and objects).

What is DOM?
Document Object Model: When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
window is also a object we can say ita parent of all objects (window.console.log("");)

Difference between console.log and console.dir
console.log - will print only message in the console or window
console.dir - will print the methods or properties of the special objects (ex: document, div)
